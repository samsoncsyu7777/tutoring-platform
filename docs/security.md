# Security Considerations

This document outlines the key security measures and best practices for the tutoring platform to ensure the safety and privacy of users, their data, and the platform’s infrastructure.

---

## 1. Authentication and Authorization

- **Google OAuth**: We will use Google OAuth for user authentication. This ensures that users sign in securely with their Google accounts, leveraging industry-standard protocols.
  
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**:
  - **Admin**: Full access to the platform’s configuration and management tools.
  - **Teacher**: Access to the class creation, management, and student dashboard.
  - **Student**: Limited access to their classes, assignments, and personal data.
  - **Parent**: Limited access to student reports and notifications.

- **Session Management**:
  - **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)** will be used for maintaining sessions.
  - Tokens will have an expiration time to enhance security, and users will need to reauthenticate when their session expires.

---

## 2. Data Protection

- **End-to-End Encryption (E2EE)**:
  - All video calls and communications will be encrypted end-to-end using the WebRTC protocol. Media transmission will not be intercepted or decrypted by the platform’s servers.

- **Data Encryption at Rest**:
  - All sensitive user data (e.g., student names, reports, assignments) will be stored encrypted in Firebase using **AES-256 encryption**.
  - Google Drive storage for class materials and student work will leverage Google’s own data encryption standards.

- **Data Encryption in Transit**:
  - All communication between the client (browser) and server will be encrypted using **TLS (Transport Layer Security)** to prevent eavesdropping and man-in-the-middle attacks.

## 3. Security for Custom Video Meetings

- **WebRTC Encryption**:
  - All video/audio streams will be encrypted using **DTLS (Datagram Transport Layer Security)**.
  - **SRTP (Secure Real-Time Transport Protocol)** will be used for encrypting media streams between participants.
  
- **Signaling Channel Security**:
  - Use **WebSockets or Socket.IO** over **wss://** (WebSocket Secure) to ensure encrypted signaling data exchange between the client and server.

- **Access Control for Video Sessions**:
  - Each video session will have an access token that is verified by the backend to ensure only authorized participants (teachers and students) can join.

---

## 4. Secure Payments

- **Stripe and PayPal** Integration:
  - Both payment systems will follow the best practices for secure payment processing.
  - **PCI-DSS** (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard) compliance is ensured for both Stripe and PayPal transactions.
  
- **Encryption of Payment Data**:
  - Payment data (credit card details) will never be stored on our platform. We will use Stripe and PayPal's secure payment gateways, which are PCI-compliant, to process all transactions.

- **Secure Subscription Management**:
  - Subscription plans will be managed securely, with personal and payment details kept safe.

---

## 5. User Privacy

- **Privacy Policy**:
  - A clear and transparent **Privacy Policy** will be presented to all users during registration. It will outline what data we collect, how it’s used, and how users can manage their preferences.

- **Data Minimization**:
  - We will follow the principle of data minimization, only collecting the necessary user information needed to provide services (e.g., name, email address, class information).
  
- **User Data Deletion**:
  - Users can request the deletion of their accounts and data. Upon request, all personal data, classwork, and other related content will be permanently deleted.

---

## 6. Threat Detection and Mitigation

- **Regular Security Audits**:
  - Regular security audits will be performed to detect vulnerabilities and patch them proactively.
  
- **Intrusion Detection**:
  - The platform will use **intrusion detection systems (IDS)** to monitor for suspicious activity or unauthorized access attempts.

- **Rate Limiting & CAPTCHA**:
  - Implement rate limiting for login attempts to prevent brute-force attacks.
  - Use CAPTCHA for account registration, login, and other sensitive operations to prevent bot abuse.

---

## 7. Security for Storage

- **Firebase Database**:
  - We will use **Firestore Security Rules** to limit access to database resources based on user roles.
  - Ensure data access and modification is restricted to authorized users only.

- **Google Drive Integration**:
  - All files stored on Google Drive will be encrypted by Google and access to these files will be controlled by the permissions set within the platform.
  
- **File Upload Restrictions**:
  - Uploaded files will be scanned for malicious content (e.g., viruses or malware) before being processed or stored.

---

## 8. Ongoing Security Practices

- **Continuous Updates**:
  - The platform’s software stack (e.g., Node.js, Next.js) will be kept up-to-date with the latest security patches.
  
- **Security Training for Developers**:
  - Regular security awareness and best practices training will be provided to the development team to ensure they follow secure coding practices.

- **Incident Response Plan**:
  - An incident response plan will be in place to address any security breaches or data leaks. This will include identifying the issue, notifying users, and providing corrective actions.

---

## 9. Future Enhancements

- **Multi-factor Authentication (MFA)**:
  - To improve the security of user accounts, multi-factor authentication (MFA) will be added in the future as an optional feature for teachers, parents, and admins.

- **Advanced AI Security**:
  - In the future, AI-based tools may be used to detect abnormal behaviors or potential fraud (e.g., unusual login times or locations).

By following these security practices and maintaining a proactive approach to risk management, we can ensure that the platform remains secure and trustworthy for all users.
