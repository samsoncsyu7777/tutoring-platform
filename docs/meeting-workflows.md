Classroom Meeting Workflow

Start:
  Teacher adjusts students' individual attributes like Video On?, Screen Lock?
  Teacher buttons: Video On/Off, Audio On/Off, Share Screen, Whiteboard, Award with Stickers, Chat
  Student buttons:  Video On/Off, Audio On/Off, Share Screen, Chat with teacher only

Teaching:
  Teacher shares screen:
    Drawing Toolbox: pen, shape, line, color, sticker, eraser, box
    Crop question and go to Classwork

  Teacher uses 1 whiteboard without scrolling:
    Drawing Toolbox
    Paste picture
    Allow all or individual students to write
    Display entire whiteboard to each student
    Crop question and go to Classwork

  Classwork:
    Teacher selects an question area on their screen to crop
    Each student has their own whiteboard
    The app crops it and pastes it on every whiteboard
    The meeting doesn’t share teacher’s screen but shows the whiteboard to the students
    Show all whiteboards on teacher’s screen
    When teacher clicks one whiteboard, it becomes full screen to let teacher write
    There are “Previous whiteboard”, “Main List”, “Next whiteboard” buttons to navigate the whiteboards
    On the main list, there is a button “Back to Lecture”, all students’ devices will focus on teacher’s screen

  The AI response features on the whiteboards during classwork:
    When the students try the classwork, the app will provide hints with AI when they wait for 8 seconds without writing anything
    When the students try every step, the app will provide feedback with AI, like “it is correct” or “here is what needs to change …”
    On teacher’s screen, show a button on every student to activate AI response or not 
    When the students answer the question completely and correctly, the app will ask a further concept or question relevant and related to the question, if time is not up

  The app will analyze the students’ classwork with AI as below:
    Analyze the keys and relevant calculation skills of the question
    Store the number of trials and the time spent by every student on every key and skill
    Show the report on teacher’s screen when the meeting is over
    Allow the teacher to edit the record and then save it
    Show a button to send the individual reports of each student to their parents.
    Promotion will be added to the email footer in the future.

  Screenshots:
    Take a screenshot shot on every student’s classwork automatically at the background when teacher back to lecture
    Show a button on teacher’s screen when teaching to screenshot the teaching materials

Storage:
  Store all teaching materials and students’ individual classwork on students’ Google Drives
  Store all teaching materials and all students’ classwork on the teacher’s Google Drive

Management:
  Remind parents to pay tuition fees by sending emails. Teachers can select at the beginning or the end of each month.
  Remind students to attend meetings by sending emails to both students and parents 24 hours ahead. Remind them to submit a leave if they are not available to attend.
  Promotion will be added to the email footer in the future.

Question Bank:
  Teachers usually use good questions in their teachings. These questions can form a question bank and can be used in the future.
  To aviod to violate copyright, the app uses AI to convert the question image(both teacher whiteboard demonstration question or classwork question) to text, edit the numbers and names with similar contexts, and store.
  If the question has a table, edit the data with similar features, and store it as a table
  If the question has a graph, create a graph with the same type, similar title, similar data and store them in a table
  If the question has a picture, use AI generate a similar picture with detailed that can be calculated. Store both AI generated picture and original picture. Admin will remove the original picture on Admin page after comparing both pictures.
  Attributes of a stored question: subject, topic, subtopic, difficulty, major age of students, country, city, language, question text, steps generated by AI, answers generated by AI, hints provided by teacher(edited with revised numbers), tables(may be more than one), graphs(may be more than one), AI and original pictures, tag for searching
