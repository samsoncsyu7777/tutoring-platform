# Self-Hosted Video Meeting System

This document outlines the strategy for building a custom video meeting system for the tutoring platform, replacing the need for third-party APIs such as Zoom. We‚Äôll leverage **WebRTC** for real-time video communication, and we may use **MediaSoup** or **Jitsi** as video servers to ensure scalability and flexibility.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies to Use

- **WebRTC (Web Real-Time Communication)**: A free, open-source technology that enables peer-to-peer data sharing and video/audio communication in web browsers. WebRTC will handle the media exchange directly between the students and teachers without the need for external servers.
  
- **Signaling Server**: A lightweight server to manage the initial setup and connection of WebRTC peers (students and teachers). We'll use **Socket.IO** or **WebSockets** for real-time bidirectional communication between the client (browser) and server.

- **MediaSoup (or Jitsi)**: 
  - **MediaSoup** is a versatile WebRTC SFU (Selective Forwarding Unit) that allows for multi-party video conferencing. It supports high-quality, low-latency video streams and has a flexible API that fits well with the needs of real-time video meetings.
  - **Jitsi** is another option that provides an open-source video conferencing solution. It comes with both server and client-side components, simplifying deployment.

- **STUN/TURN Servers**: To handle NAT traversal (making sure peers can connect to each other across different networks), we‚Äôll need a **STUN server** for public address discovery, and a **TURN server** for relay when direct peer-to-peer connection isn‚Äôt possible.

## üßë‚Äçüíª System Architecture

1. **Frontend (Web Browser)**:
   - **Peer-to-Peer Connection (WebRTC)**: The client side of the video call will utilize the WebRTC API for video and audio streaming.
   - **Signaling Channel**: The WebSocket or Socket.IO server will handle the exchange of signaling messages (e.g., ICE candidates, SDP offer/answer).
   
2. **Backend (Node.js/Express)**:
   - **Signaling Server**: A simple Node.js server will handle client signaling and connection orchestration.
   - **Media Server**: Using MediaSoup or Jitsi, the backend will handle complex media routing, enabling video conferences with multiple participants (teacher and students).

## üí° Key Features

- **Multi-party Video Calls**: Teachers and students will be able to connect in a group call, with each student having a separate video stream.
  
- **Screen Sharing**: Teachers will be able to share their screen with students for visual presentations. 

- **Text Chat**: A messaging feature for teachers and students to share messages during class.

- **Custom Controls**: 
  - **Teacher control** over muting/unmuting, enabling/disabling video, and screen sharing.
  - **Focus Mode**: Teachers will be able to lock student focus by forcing fullscreen or locking the screen.

- **Recording**: Option to record sessions, saving them to a cloud storage service like Google Drive for later access.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Implementation Plan

1. **Set up WebRTC Signaling**:
   - Use Socket.IO or WebSockets to establish connections and manage signaling data (e.g., ICE candidates and SDP).

2. **Set up Media Server (MediaSoup or Jitsi)**:
   - **MediaSoup**: Set up a MediaSoup server to handle media routing and streaming.
   - **Jitsi**: Set up a Jitsi server to handle multi-party video communication. Jitsi Meet can also be customized for our needs.

3. **Integrate Frontend with WebRTC**:
   - Use WebRTC API in the browser to enable video streaming.
   - Implement UI elements for starting/stopping video calls, muting/unmuting audio, and sharing screens.

4. **Test Scalability and Performance**:
   - Test with multiple users to ensure the system can handle video calls with many students and maintain video quality.

## üí° Considerations

- **Bandwidth Optimization**: Ensure that the system is capable of adjusting video quality based on the user's available bandwidth.
  
- **Security**: Ensure that all video calls are encrypted, and implement user authentication and authorization to protect user data.

- **Cross-browser Support**: Ensure compatibility with modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari).

- **Load Balancing**: If using MediaSoup or Jitsi, ensure there are appropriate strategies in place for handling load and scaling based on the number of concurrent video calls.

## üìà Future Enhancements

- **Mobile Support**: While the initial focus is on desktops and tablets, eventually consider building mobile clients or improving browser compatibility for mobile devices.
  
- **AI Integration**: Add features like AI-driven feedback during video calls (e.g., facial expression recognition or engagement monitoring).

This custom video meeting solution ensures full control over video calls and the potential for future scalability and feature enhancements without being dependent on third-party providers like Zoom.
